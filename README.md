# alphabet-ttf
TrueType font of DMT-inspired alphabet for sigil magick

Alphabet drawn up on paper after a hit of Dimethyltriptamine 
for use in chaos magick sigils.

Process is currently copying the shape and accents from the
original sheet of paper in GIMP, saving each letter
 as an individual PNG file format - and vectorising in FontForge.

# To-do
- Pronounciation
- Lower-case letters
(these will both require psychedelic experiences, and due to time
and 'functioning next day' constraints, may be a while)
- 'Handwritten' script
- Various Blender functions in the form of an addon for sigil generation
- Most importantly: complete the alphabet.
